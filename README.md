# horiseon


With this code I have added semantic HTML and grouped up the HTML elements in a more logical and practical way

I added alt codes to the pictures to make them searchable

I changed the title of the page to be Horiseon instead of the generic webpage name

I fixed the first attribute in the heading to link down to its designated spot on the website

I organized the styles sheet to keep the elements more grouped together as well has consolidated some of the code so it isn't so long and repeatitive.
